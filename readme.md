# Selenium-Java-Cucumber-TestNG-ParallelTest
Web automation testing using Selenium, Cucumber, Java, design pattern Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory, and TestNG library for parallel testing.
<br /> This automation support:
- Run same scenarios using 1 web driver.
- Run different scenarios using 1 web driver.
- Run same scenarios using more than 1 web driver.
- Run different scenarios using more than 1 web driver.

## 1. POM

This automation created using POM design pattern. What is POM? POM stands for Page Object Model. POM is a design pattern used to make automation. Where each page an application or website is used as its own class. This gives an advantage when one of a page's interface changes, then other classes will not be affected. 

## 2. Cucumber dan Gherkin

Then for Scenario scripting, we will use Cucumber and Gherkin.<br/>
What is Cucumber? What is Gherkin?<br/>
**Cucumber** is a tool that supports BDD *(Behavior-Driven Development)*.<br/>
**Gherkin** is a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough to be understood by Cucumber. Scenario scripts are written using Gherkin.<br/><br/>Ref: https://docs.cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/
